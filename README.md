  This project is based from [The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects! by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
  
  The HTML and CSS was already made by the course creator. In this project you have to focus only on the JavaScript part.
  
  ### Game Rules
  
    1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
    2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
    3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it’s the next player’s turn
    4. The player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his/her ROUND score gets added to the GLOBAL score. After that, it’s the next player’s turn
    5. The first player to reach the user-set winning score (In my case 100) wins the game
